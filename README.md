# Edvora

Edvora is a simple web-based project built during our **first hackathon**, **Dawn of Code**, organized by the **MERN Matrix Club, VIT Bhopal**.

The idea behind Edvora is **smarter knowledge sharing** — providing a basic platform where users can explore, share, and discuss knowledge in a more organized way.

This project was developed in a limited time during the hackathon and focuses more on learning, collaboration, and implementation rather than being a complete production-ready solution.
